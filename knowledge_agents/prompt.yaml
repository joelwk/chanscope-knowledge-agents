      Analyze this content objectively, focusing only on facts and evidence present in the text:
      
      {content}
      
      Report:
      1. What factual statements can be extracted?
      2. What quantitative metrics are present?
      3. What direct evidence supports these findings?

      Results: {results}
      
      Consider:
      1. What patterns are consistently observed across chunks?
      2. What quantitative metrics can be aggregated?
      3. Where do the analyses agree or differ?
      4. How strong is the evidence for each finding?
