# Chanscope Implementation Documentation

This document outlines the implementation of the Chanscope approach in our data processing pipeline. The implementation adheres to the guidelines specified in the `approach-chanscope.mdc` file.

## Overview

The Chanscope approach establishes a complete pipeline for data ingestion, stratification, and embedding generation with specific behaviors for the query processing based on the `force_refresh` flag.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Data Retention Support

- Added `DATA_RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable (defaults to 30 days)
- Enhanced `scheduled_update.py` to use data retention settings
- Updated `setup.sh` to expose the retention setting
- Modified `config/base_settings.py` to include retention configuration

### 2. Data Processing Orchestration

- Enhanced initial startup logic to separate data ingestion from embedding generation
- Added `generate_embeddings` method to `DataOperations` for explicit embedding generation
- Modified `_prepare_data_if_needed` in `api/routes.py` to implement Chanscope logic:
  - With `force_refresh=true`, only refresh complete data if not current, always refresh stratified data and embeddings
  - With `force_refresh=false`, use existing data if available, only refresh if missing

### 3. Scheduled Updates

- Updated the scheduler implementation to run with configurable intervals
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Implemented tools to manage the scheduler

## Testing the Implementation

1. Run the test script to verify the implementation:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
chmod +x scripts/test_chanscope_implementation.sh
./scripts/test_chanscope_implementation.sh

# On Windows
python scripts/scheduled_update.py
```

2. Test via the API:

```bash
# Test query with force_refresh=false
curl -X POST http://localhost/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "test query", "force_refresh": false}'

# Test query with force_refresh=true
curl -X POST http://localhost/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "test query", "force_refresh": true}'
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Further Enhancements

- [ ] **Add Monitoring Endpoints**
  - Add API endpoints to monitor data freshness
  - Create dashboard for data processing status

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Profile the data pipeline to identify bottlenecks
  - Implement parallel processing for embedding generation
  - Optimize memory usage for large datasets

- [ ] **Error Recovery Mechanisms**
  - Add retry logic for S3 operations
  - Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
  - Add recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations

### 2. Additional Testing

- [ ] **Functional Testing**
  - Test data retention logic with mock S3 data
  - Verify proper behavior of `force_refresh` under various conditions
  - Test different retention periods

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - Measure embedding generation performance
  - Test with various dataset sizes
  - Benchmark end-to-end query processing time

- [ ] **Resilience Testing**
  - Test system behavior during S3 connectivity issues
  - Verify recovery after scheduler process interruption
  - Test handling of corrupted or incomplete data files

### 3. Documentation Updates

- [ ] **Update API Documentation**
  - Document the `force_refresh` behavior
  - Create detailed endpoint descriptions
  - Document query parameter effects

- [ ] **Operational Guides**
  - Create runbooks for managing the scheduler
  - Document monitoring and alerting recommendations
  - Provide performance tuning guidelines

## Conclusion

The implemented changes align the system with the Chanscope approach specified in `approach-chanscope.mdc`. The system now properly separates data ingestion, stratification, and embedding generation, and handles the `force_refresh` flag according to the specified behavior.

Further testing and refinement will ensure the robustness and performance of the implementation in production environments.
