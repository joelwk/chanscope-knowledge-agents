# Knowledge Agent Advanced Command Reference

## 1. Core Data Management Operations

### 1.1. Standard Refresh (Preserves Existing Stratified Sample)
# Processes all data files, but REUSES existing stratified sample and embeddings
# This does NOT regenerate the stratified sample unless completely missing
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh

### 1.2. Force Complete Refresh (Regenerates Everything)
# Processes all data files AND regenerates stratified sample and embeddings
# Use this to ensure your stratified sample reflects the latest data
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --force-refresh

### 1.3. Two-Stage Refresh (For Memory-Constrained Environments)
# First: Process data and regenerate sample, skip time-consuming embeddings
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --force-refresh --skip-embeddings
# Later: Generate embeddings from the refreshed sample
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py embeddings

### 1.4. Continuous Data Processing Options
# Basic: Refresh data hourly but KEEP existing stratified sample
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --continuous --interval=3600

# Comprehensive: Refresh data AND regenerate stratified sample hourly (recommended)
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --continuous --force-refresh --interval=3600

# Memory-optimized: Update data hourly, regenerate sample daily
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --continuous --interval=3600 --force-refresh-interval=86400

### 1.5. Time-Bounded Refresh
# Process data from a specific date forward
# Note: This does NOT affect whether stratified sample is regenerated
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --filter-date="2025-04-01"

# Process data from a specific date AND regenerate stratified sample
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py refresh --filter-date="2025-04-01" --force-refresh

### 1.6. System Status Check
# View row counts, sample/embedding status, and environment detection
poetry run python scripts/scheduled_update.py status
